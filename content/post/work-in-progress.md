I created this blog to show an example of how to deploy containers amazon ECS using terraform. 
I have open sourced both the blog content and also the terraform code used to create all the infrastructure.<br>

[blog github repo](https://github.com/willejs/willejs.io)<br>
[terraform code github repo](https://github.com/willejs/willejs.io-terraform)<br>


Check out the milestones in each github repo for whats to come.<br>

I could have easily built this static site and published it to S3 or used github static pages, but thought that actually this would be a more interesting way of doing so.
